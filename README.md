# react-base-app --webspace

by @bertz-tech and @ShapeGroup / react base app boilerplate injected directly in html template

Currently in this exemple:

- react model in a standard web:
    1. boilerplate with <b>Babel JSX</b>
    2. boilerplate with <b>plain Js</b>

extra note:

all hooks (you need to transation from node jsx to normal js):
[react-base-app-nodejs](https://github.com/jsReact-collection/react-base-app-nodejs) or 
[react... / hookscripts](https://github.com/jsReact-collection/react-base-app-nodejs/tree/main/src/resources/components)

for use "import" you need a http server (node or php or other)<br>
ex: `import TestComponent from "./testcomponent.js"`
